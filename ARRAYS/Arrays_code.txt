How to initialize an array?

<write various forms of initization>

1. When we initialize an array inside a function locally, it gets garbage values. MAX_SIZE = 10^6
2. When we initialize a global array, it is filled with zeroes. MAX_SIZE = 10^7
3. Array indexing is from 0 to n-1 if size is n.

PRINT AN ARRAY
for (i = 0; i<n; i++){
    cout << arr[i];
}

WHAT HAPPENS IN COMPUTER MEMORY?
1. A contigous series of block is allocated. First block address is randomly chosen from few space. 
2. Next few blocks are stored at address x+i, x+2i, x+3i and so on where i is the size of each block. (depends on data type)

SPACE COMPLEXITY
1. There is some space that problem comes with, space complexity we see the extra space that we are using.
